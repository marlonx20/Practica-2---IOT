# Practica-2---IOT
Code for the second practice in the IOT subject


This is just the code for activate 4 pines in the raspberry pi, in order to turn on LEDS that were conected to the rspi.
First, in the bash script, i go to the path where the gpios are, then i activate each gpio in order to be able to use, after it i assigned its  direction like "out", then assigned a 1 value to it for turn it on and 0 for turb it off, finaly unactivate each gpio.
It was all.
